Here is my personal homepage, where you can learn more about my work and life in detail.

About myself
======
I am currently studying at the Purple Mountain Observatory, focusing on nuclear radiation readout electronics in astronomy. I am friendly and eager to learn new things and skills. I have a wide range of interests, including photography, skateboarding, and skiing. I look forward to the chance to connect and work together.
