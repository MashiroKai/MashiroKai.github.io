The testing system consists of both hardware and software components. The circuit board in between is the FEE (Front-End Electronics) board on the LNGS, which is currently collecting current pulses generated by the photomultiplier tubes on the left side.

We use testing software on the PC to process and display the data received from the ground test board. The testing software is powerful, featuring numerous automated functions such as automatic serial port detection, automatic command sequence transmission, and scheduled command sending. On the left, compressed energy spectra for neutrons and gamma rays are displayed separately. Through these compressed spectra, experimenters can understand the basic shape of the energy spectrum, helping to assess if the detector is functioning properly. The table on the right shows engineering parameters returned by the detector’s frontend electronics, providing insight into the detector’s current status.

The ground test board can be configured via the JTAG port, allowing for flexible modifications to the FPGA's internal program to perform various complex tasks. This includes real-time detection of communication errors, packaging of scientific data, and controlling communication timing, among other functions.
