We used a single crystal paired with a single SiPM to verify the method of encoding positional information using a resistor network.Through a resistor network, 64 SiPM signals can be encoded into four output channels. The SiPM signal from each position creates a specific distribution of weights across the four output ports, enabling the identification of the signalâ€™s origin based on this principle.

An interesting design utilizes a magnetic connector to create a power baseboard, allowing small modules to easily attach and receive power. The power board can supply up to three different voltage level, this is very useful for modular designs.

We use a 14-bit ADC to sample the SiPM signals, and the board below is a prototype of the ADC circuit. Test results show that this circuit board operates correctly.

To filter effective signals, a well-designed trigger circuit logic is essential. This small board includes a 7ns comparator and a 12-bit DAC, allowing the trigger threshold to be adjusted using buttons on the development board. To reduce false triggers from simulated noise interference, we added a degree of hysteresis to the comparator.
