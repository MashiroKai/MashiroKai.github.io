The Lunar Neutron Gamma Spectrometer (LNGS) is a payload on the Chang’e-7 orbiter, controlled by the orbiter payload management system. Its primary scientific goal is to measure the abundance and distribution of water, ice, and major elements across the lunar surface. During the development of the payload, a testing system is required to simulate the orbiter payload management system and test the various functions of LNGS. The testing system mainly consists of two parts: the ground test board and the host computer software. These are developed based on FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) and LabWindows/CVI, respectively. The system achieves interactive control of the payload and data analysis through an interface, significantly improving the testing efficiency and stability, and ensuring the smooth development of the payload.
